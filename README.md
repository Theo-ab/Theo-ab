# Theo Alvarado Bisson

I build **clean, fast web experiences** and **automation systems** that remove manual work and make businesses more money.

I care about:

- Pages that **load fast**, look modern, and don’t confuse the user.
- Workflows that **run without you**, not more dashboards to babysit.
- Clear numbers: leads, calls booked, revenue — not vanity metrics.

## What I work on

- Conversion-focused websites and landing pages  
- Automations around lead capture, follow-up, and booking  
- Systems that glue together tools like email, SMS, chat, and CRMs  

Most of the useful stuff I build is either private or under NDA.  
If you’re looking for a portfolio of toy apps, this isn’t it.

## Tech I actually use

- **Web**: HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, React/Next.js
- **Automation**: n8n, Make, Telegram bots, webhooks, APIs
- **Infra / glue**: Node.js, Python, AWS, Vercel, misc third-party APIs

---

## How I like to work

- Start from the outcome (leads/revenue/time saved), then design backwards.
- Ship a working version fast, then iterate based on real usage.
- Automate anything that happens more than twice.

If you want to talk, bring a real problem and real stakes.
